# Kanister - Application-Level Data Management

## Why do i need to use Kanister

When working with systems that store and manage important data (like complex databases), special tools are needed to make sure that the data is handled correctly. This is especially true when these programs are designed to run on cloud-based servers. 

The tools that are typically used to manage cloud-based programs are good at controlling the basic functions of the servers (like turning them on and off), but they don't always have the ability to manage the data in the same sophisticated way that other tools can. 

So, when it comes to managing complex databases, for example, we need to use tools that are specifically designed to understand the data and how it's organized.
