# Key Concepts and Terminologies
**Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.**

### Cluster Architecture
    A Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of worker machines, called nodes, that run containerized applications. Every cluster has at least one worker node. In clusters that have only 1 node, the control-plane is also the worker! Nodes within a cluster can be provided with labels to help when selecting nodes to attach pods once the cluster is created.
