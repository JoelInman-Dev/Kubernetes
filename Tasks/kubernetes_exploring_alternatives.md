# Kubernetes is not the ONLY Container Orchestration Platform

## Apache Mesos

Apache Mesos is an open-source platform that manages clusters of servers. It was introduced in 2009, before the widespread adoption of containers after Docker's launch in 2013.

Mesos takes a user-defined workload, called a task, and runs it on a cluster of servers. It can run not only containers but also non-containerized applications.

Although Kubernetes is currently the most popular orchestration platform, it initially faced competition from other container orchestrators such as Docker Swarm and Mesos.
